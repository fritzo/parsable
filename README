parsable.py is a super lightweight set of decorators that lets you add
command-line parsing to scripts with minimal effort.

How To Use parsable.py:

1. copy parsable.py into your project and

  import parsable

2. decorate functions you want parsed as follows

  @parsable.command
  def my_function (required_arg, optional_arg = 1):
      'Help messages are not just a good idea --they are required'
      ...

3. finish the script with

  if __name__ == '__parsable__': parsable.dispatch()
    
That's it: 3 short lines of syntax!
